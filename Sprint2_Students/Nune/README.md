The folders include the 4 code variations I worked on during Sprint 2:
  Rest is the first version, changing the words to rest one by one
  Rest, please changes the text to a randomly chosen phrase from a list provided by me
  The "+" indicates that those versions change the images as well

The uploaded image names are more or less self-explanatory. I included:
  2 screenshots of generated poetry,
  the first tryout I did /didn't show it today, it changed the whole text in a container into rest and not the separate words/
  and a screenshot of Rest, please

In the Teams folder for Screenrecordings, I added all documentations of process that I did.
I will sort them by date and give clearer titles to make them more understandable.

/I will include a recording of Gwyneth Paltrow reading poetry in the Teams folder as well/

enjoy and rest :)
