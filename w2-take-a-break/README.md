* reading network messages using background scripts


## Background Scripts
> reference [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Background_scripts)

This scripts are useful to interact with some part of the browser that are ususally not accessible from content scripts.

For example:
* [web requests](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Intercept_HTTP_requests)
* [cookies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Work_with_the_Cookies_API)
* [tabs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Working_with_the_Tabs_API)

To work with the data from this function it is essential to learn about Objects and Arrays
* [Arrays](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/Arrays)
* [Objects](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object)

**‼️‼️‼️‼️ATTENZIONE‼️‼️‼️**

Message passing between content and background script can be a bit complicated.
