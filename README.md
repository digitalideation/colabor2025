## Module Content
We will explore coding in a playful, collaborative way to generate visuals – experimentation and allowing for chance will be part of this process. Different sprints will guide our curiosity, each involving learning about historical and theoretical contexts from early computer art, generative design, net art and algorithmic design. <br/>
In Sprint 1 we are inspired by the concepts and aesthetics of the broader field of early computer art (Vera Molnár, Bridget Riley, John Whitney, Lillian F. Schwartz and others) and reinterpret these works using contemporary techniques. We gain technical, aesthetic, conceptual and analytical knowledge. <br/>
In Sprint 2, we look at how digital devices are 'scripted' to encourage certain interactions while excluding or making others invisible. Technically, we could interact with our devices in many ways, but cultural norms and design choices limit these possibilities. We look at works and strategies by Lauren McCarthy, Yehwan Song, Rafaël Rozendaal and others and design a series of speculative, artistic, intervening settings in which we use critique, interaction, camera, gyroscope, microphone and machine learning to reflect on our interactions. <br/>
In Sprint 3, each group immerses itself into a selected project from the previous two sprints and works on how it can be performed or presented at the final festival.<br/>
For each sprint work groups alternate. The focus is on building the ability to prototype quickly to test and iteratively improve ideas, with an emphasis on experimentation. Collaboration is important here as well - coding as craft and as a caring activity. Basic programming concepts are taught practically and with reference to topics from art, design and computer aesthetics. Work is carried out in particular in the relevant technologies such as JavaScript and p5.js. The entire process is reflected upon in individual portfolios, documented and published on a web platform.<br/>

## Deliverables 
### Sprint 1
Re-Creation of an algorithmic artwork in p5.js 
* Presentation 6th may
### Sprint 2
Browser Extension around the topic 'Take a Break'
* Presentation 19th may
### Sprint 3
Create-Share-Show: your own menu, your own rules, your own setting. 
You’ll share and present your work twice:
*	First, on June 3rd, within our group—a more intimate, working context.
* 	Then again, on June 5th, at the festival, where your work will be part of a broader public presentation.
### Documentation 
You’ll each be creating a documentation website.
This site will bring together everything you’ve worked on: your experiments, your thoughts, and the outcomes of all three sprints.
It’s not just a side task—it's part of your project. The website will be published, and it serves as a way to reflect on and present your process. The writing assignement (next chapter) is part of the documentation.


## Writing Assignment for Online Process Documentation and Festival
Briefly present your results and give a brief written account of the decisions you made during Sprint 1. Which historical work did you choose as a starting point and why? What did you learn about this historical work through re-coding? This process reflection should accompany your online process gallery for Sprint 1 and be no longer than 400 words.<br/>

Explain your result from Sprint 2 and then answer the following questions: What did I try that worked well for me? What would I do differently next time? This process reflection should accompany your online process gallery for Sprint 2 and should not be longer than 400 words.<br/>

The texts for the festival are based on the texts for the online process documentation. The festival texts are aimed at a broad audience, briefly describe the project and give an insight into the process. They should not be longer than 400 words.

## Criteria
Research and design process (exploration of the medium, originality of approaches, degree of reflection in process documentation)<br/>
Autonomy in creative and technical implementation<br/>
Creative and technical quality of the results<br/>
Active participation (min. 80%), oral presentations, feedback to peers, collaboration and contributions<br/>
